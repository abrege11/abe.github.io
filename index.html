                        I graduated from Alpena High School in the class of 2022.
                        My junior year of high school, I enrolled in the Early College
                        program, which would lead me to start my freshman year of College
                        at Alpena Community College during my senior year. After graduating
                        in 2022, I stayed at ACC to complete my associates degree in Computer
                        Information Systems which I completed in 2023. In the fall of 2023,
                        I will be attending Nothern Michigan Univeristy to complete my
                        bachelors degree in computer science.

                        In high school I played soccer at a varsity level and 
                        ran track. I had learned skills from these sports being
                        the captain of the soccer team the 2022 season. I also
                        was awarded the golden boot award for scoring the most goals
                        on the team in the season. These years playing sports
                        have taught me many life lessons and how to become a hard working,
                        goal oriented person that carries over to the workplace.

                        In my free time, I like to spend time with my friends and family,
                        enjoy nature, workout, practice my programming working on side
                        projects, and playing soccer. I enjoy these things because 
                        they help me better myself and improve on all aspects of my
                        well being!

                        This is a face matching application using image processing in python.
                        For this project I used template matching, so it isn't the greatest 
                        for certain angles, lighting, things like that, but it works great 
                        for what I needed it to! I plan to implement a more advanced version
                        of this in an upcoming app that I am making,

                       This is the first iPhone app that I made. I wanted to get the basics of
                       the SwiftUI framework and also I have always wanted a simple, no extra
                       features macronutrient calculator, and this was a great exercise! It was
                       the perfect small project to start and I can't wait to go further in the
                       realm of IOS development.

                        This project was my first time messing around with webscraping
                        using beautiful soup and data science. I took the data from a website that listed
                        the roster of the entire NBA league each year and created an 
                        algorithm that would get you every year that the player you 
                        entered played. Although the project isn't too large in size,
                        it was a great way to advance my understanding of data structures and algorithms.
